# Wikipedia-Search
Building a Wikipedia Search App
## Rules:
1. Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.
2. You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.
3. Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.
## User Stories:
In software development and product management, a user story is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.
- As a user, I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
- As a user, I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
- As a user, when I type in the search box, I can see a dropdown menu with autocomplete options for matching Wikipedia entries.
## Notes:
